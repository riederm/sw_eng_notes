## PATH variable

:heavy_check_mark: The PATH variable on Windows, Linux and Mac OS specifies the directories in which executable programs are located on the machine that can be started without knowing and typing the whole path to the file on the command line.

:heavy_check_mark: On Linux and Mac Os, it usually holds all bin and sbin directories relevant for the current user. On Windows, it contains at least the <p><code>C:\Windows</code></p> and <p><code>C:\Windows\system32</p></code> directories. 
That is also the reason why we can run calc.exe or notepad.exe from the command line, but not firefox.exe because it is located in the mozillafirefox folder.

:heavy_check_mark:Type in the command <p><code>calc</p></code> in the CMD and the calculator will open.

:heavy_check_mark:You can add support for file extensions other than .exe by editing %PATHEXT%.
